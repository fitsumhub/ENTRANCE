            <h3>Important English Grammar Concepts:</h3>
            <p>In this quiz, we will focus on key aspects of English grammar. Below is a brief overview of important topics to keep in mind:</p>

            <h4>1. Verb Tenses</h4>
            <p>Verb tenses indicate when an action takes place. In English, there are three main tenses: past, present, and future, each with different forms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Present Tense:</strong> Used to describe actions that are happening now or regularly. Example: "She eats lunch every day."</li>
                <li><strong>Past Tense:</strong> Used to describe actions that happened in the past. Example: "He played football yesterday."</li>
                <li><strong>Future Tense:</strong> Used to describe actions that will happen. Example: "They will travel to the beach next week."</li>
                <li><strong>Present Perfect:</strong> Describes an action that has been completed at the time of speaking or has relevance to the present. Example: "I have finished my homework."</li>
                <li><strong>Past Perfect:</strong> Describes an action that was completed before another action in the past. Example: "She had already left when I arrived."</li>
                <li><strong>Future Perfect:</strong> Describes an action that will be completed before a certain point in the future. Example: "By next year, they will have completed the project."</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Subject-Verb Agreement</h4>
            <p>Subject-verb agreement means that the subject and verb in a sentence must agree in number (singular or plural).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular. Example: "She writes daily."</li>
                <li>If the subject is plural, the verb must also be plural. Example: "They write daily."</li>
                <li>For third-person singular subjects (he, she, it), add an 's' or 'es' to the verb. Example: "He talks loudly."</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Active and Passive Voice</h4>
            <p>The active voice is used when the subject of the sentence performs the action, while the passive voice is used when the subject receives the action.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Active Voice:</strong> "The teacher explains the lesson."</li>
                <li><strong>Passive Voice:</strong> "The lesson is explained by the teacher."</li>
                <li>To form the passive voice, use a form of the verb "to be" plus the past participle of the main verb. Example: "The cake was baked by Mary."</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Conditional Sentences</h4>
            <p>Conditional sentences express situations that could happen or have happened under certain conditions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zero Conditional:</strong> Used for universal truths or scientific facts. Example: "If you heat ice, it melts."</li>
                <li><strong>First Conditional:</strong> Used for real or possible situations in the present or future. Example: "If it rains tomorrow, I will stay home."</li>
                <li><strong>Second Conditional:</strong> Used for hypothetical situations in the present or future. Example: "If I were rich, I would travel the world."</li>
                <li><strong>Third Conditional:</strong> Used for situations that didnâ€™t happen in the past. Example: "If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam."</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>5. Modals of Advice and Obligation</h4>
            <p>Modal verbs express necessity, possibility, and advice. Common modals include "can," "could," "should," "must," and "might."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Can:</strong> Used for ability or permission. Example: "She can swim well."</li>
                <li><strong>Should:</strong> Used to give advice or suggestions. Example: "You should eat more vegetables."</li>
                <li><strong>Must:</strong> Used for strong obligation or necessity. Example: "You must finish your homework before going out."</li>
                <strong>May/Might:</strong> Used to express possibility. Example: "It may rain later today."
            </ul>

            <h4>6. Articles</h4>
            <p>Articles define whether we are referring to something specific or general.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definite Article "the":</strong> Used to refer to something specific. Example: "The book on the table is mine."</li>
                <li><strong>Indefinite Articles "a" and "an":</strong> Used to refer to something general. Example: "I need a pen." (Any pen, not specific) "I saw an elephant." (Any elephant)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>7. Adjectives and Adverbs</h4>
            <p>Adjectives describe nouns, while adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adjectives:</strong> "The tall building" (describes the noun "building").</li>
                <li><strong>Adverbs:</strong> "She sings beautifully" (describes the verb "sings").</li>
                <li>Adverbs can also modify adjectives: "He is extremely tall" (modifying the adjective "tall").</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>8. Pronouns</h4>
            <p>Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Pronouns:</strong> I, you, he, she, it, we, they</li>
                <li><strong>Possessive Pronouns:</strong> mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs</li>
                <li><strong>Reflexive Pronouns:</strong> myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, themselves</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>9. Prepositions</h4>
            <p>Prepositions show relationships between nouns or pronouns and other words in a sentence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Prepositions:</strong> in, on, at (e.g., "I will meet you at 5 PM.")</li>
                <li><strong>Place Prepositions:</strong> in, on, at (e.g., "The book is on the table.")</li>
                <li><strong>Direction Prepositions:</strong> to, into, onto (e.g., "She walked into the room.")</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>10. Sentence Types</h4>
            <p>English sentences can be categorized by their structure and purpose.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Declarative:</strong> A statement. Example: "She is reading a book."</li>
                <li><strong>Interrogative:</strong> A question. Example: "Are you coming to the party?"</li>
                <li><strong>Imperative:</strong> A command or request. Example: "Please close the door."</li>
                <li><strong>Exclamatory:</strong> A sentence expressing strong emotion. Example: "Wow, that's amazing!"</li>
            </ul>
